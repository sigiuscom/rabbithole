# Scenario-to-test manifest

This manifest classifies each logical test case, not each assertion. Categories are: **C1 compatibility contract** (external formats, wire protocols, migrations), **C2 behavioral product contract** (user-visible behavior changed only intentionally), **C3 implementation snapshot** (migration-disposable implementation detail), **C4 known defect** (a tripwire for behavior intended to be replaced), and **C5 design target** (new intended behavior written ahead of implementation). C4 cases are deliberately marked so they never become golden truth. Update this file whenever a test case is added, removed, split, renamed, or materially changed.

Scenario references use the Part VI group and shortened ledger wording. `—` means the case protects behavior outside the current ledger. Cases in the unwired eval are inventoried even though `npm test` does not run them.

| settings Escape/outside-pointer restore trigger focus | C2 | Enforces visible focus continuity for both stack dismissal paths (`stage10-web-verify.mjs:450-458`). | Chrome: focus restoration after transient surfaces |

| Case | Category | Rationale | Scenario-ledger entries covered |
|---|---|---|---|

| Case | Category | Rationale | Scenario-ledger entries covered |
|---|---|---|---|
| all corpus fixtures are normalized fixed points and export-idempotent | C1 | Protects portable migration, assets, durable asks, and filesystem persistence across repeated import/export projections. Exports are anchored to the source file (not merely to each other), so a field silently dropped by the export path cannot cancel out; the two legacy fixtures are exempt from source-anchoring because import deliberately migrates them. | Data: portable compatibility; `schema_version: null`; unicode/emoji/RTL; very wide holes; durable asks per host semantics |
| import collision mints a fresh hole_id and preserves content | C1 | Protects collision-safe identity generation without content or asset loss. | Data: import ID collision |

| branch_request missing parent throws | C2 | Invalid branch requests must fail rather than create detached nodes. | — |
| branch_request missing node_id throws | C2 | Branch nodes require stable identity. | — |
| node_progress grows then idempotently replays | C2 | Full-markdown replacement and same-text replay define current streaming behavior. | Generation: durable streaming (reducer side) |
| stale same-run node_progress is discarded | C2 | The reducer is the single ordering authority for tagged progress and rejects non-increasing sequence numbers without changing state. | Generation: stale progress after newer progress |
| higher same-run node_progress is accepted | C2 | Increasing sequence numbers advance both markdown and the ephemeral per-node run record. | Generation: stale progress after newer progress |
| new node_progress run id supersedes | C2 | A retry is a new run and supersedes the prior run regardless of its sequence number. | Generation: stale progress after newer progress |
| node_answered clears progress ordering record | C2 | Completion ends the recorded run, so later tagged progress follows the no-record acceptance path. | Generation: stale progress after newer progress |
| delete_node clears progress ordering record | C2 | Removed node identities retain no ephemeral run history if an id is later reused. | Generation: delete-while-streaming; stale progress after newer progress |
| node_answered updates existing pending node | C2 | Completing an existing pending node is core generation behavior. | — |
| node_answered synthesizes unknown node | C2 | Final answers may materialize a node when no pending node exists. | — |
| delete_node subtree collection and effects | C2 | Deletion must remove descendants and return sufficient effect data for consumers. | — |

| root delete throws | C2 | The starting document is protected from node deletion. | — |
| node_update and nodes_update field application | C2 | Supported presentation fields must normalize consistently while unknown nodes remain untouched. | — |
| view_state normalization | C2 | Persisted navigation state has a normalized shape and bounded camera scale. | — |
| hole_title replaces document title | C2 | Internal title changes must flow through the immutable engine without changing MCP/SSE vocabulary. | — |

| malformed known node_progress is a no-op | C2 | Pins the reducer's current coercive/no-validation behavior for malformed trusted-engine input. | — |
| unknown event type throws | C2 | Unsupported vocabulary must fail explicitly rather than silently diverge. | — |
| frozen-input reducer immutability | C2 | The reducer must not mutate its input state, node map, event, or node objects; changed nodes receive fresh identity. | — |
| Node/Chromium reducer parity | C2 | The deterministic DOM-free reducer must produce identical projections in both supported execution contexts. | — |

## `stage15-security-migrations-verify.mjs`

| Case | Category | Rationale | Scenario-ledger entries covered |

| pre-popover custom/local canonical migration (`stage15-security-migrations-verify.mjs:162-165`) | C1 | Preserves local settings and session-only choice while adopting the stray OpenRouter-era credential without assigning it to Local. | Data: preference/credential storage through every migration |
| removed Anthropic/OpenAI provider canonical rewrite (`stage15-security-migrations-verify.mjs:168-177`) | C1 | Requires aliases to rewrite to OpenRouter defaults while preserving unrelated preferences and credentials. | Data: preference/credential storage through every migration; provider-id renames |
| malformed settings and credential-map normalization (`stage15-security-migrations-verify.mjs:180-187`) | C1 | Invalid settings JSON loads canonical defaults and an array key map normalizes to empty without throwing. | Data: malformed JSON/hand-edited preference storage; Migration/deploy: idempotent migrations |

## `stage16-budget-gauges.mjs`

Gauges are machine-relative: `test/budgets.json` records `{baseline, tolerance, ceiling, rationale, measured_at_commit}` per gauge; `node test/calibrate-budgets.mjs` re-baselines deliberately. Any worsening requires an explicit recorded trade-off (THESEUS Part III).

| Case | Category | Rationale | Scenario-ledger entries covered |
|---|---|---|---|
| live + frozen client bundle byte gauges | C3 | Bundle sizes are implementation-relative; the ratcheted ceiling catches accidental bloat without blessing current size as a contract. | Data: bundle-size budget |
| snapshot byte gauges (math + asset reference corpus) | C2 | Frozen HTML is a user-shared artifact; its size envelope for reference content is product behavior. | Data: snapshot bytes budget |
| snapshot build-time gauges | C2 | Export must stay interactive-fast for reference content; min-of-samples with 3x ceiling absorbs host noise. | Data: snapshot build-time budget |
| cold-open gauge | C2 | Time to the visible interactive landing composer is the first-load product experience. | Rendering: cold open budget |
| streaming DOM batch count + duration gauges | C2 | A fixed 40-update synthetic stream must stay rAF-coalesced; losing batching is a user-visible regression. | Generation: streaming update budget (rAF count/duration) |
| save-window gauge | C2 | Elapsed time from final streamed update to persisted markdown bounds the data-loss window on tab close. | Data: export-vs-debounce save window (web path) |

## `stage17-packaging-smoke.mjs`

This release-only check runs through `npm run test:packaging`, outside the default suite, and is matrixed across Node 18 and 20 in CI.

| Case | Category | Rationale | Scenario-ledger entries covered |
|---|---|---|---|
| packed artifact contains executable, metadata, runtime source, and committed bundles | C1 | The npm tarball is the public installation contract; every raw Node/core runtime file and built browser asset required by the executable must ship. | Migration/deploy: publish contents and CLI installation compatibility |
| installed tarball launches and completes MCP initialize | C2 | A clean consumer project must be able to invoke the installed CLI and receive only a valid MCP initialize response on stdout before clean shutdown. | Migration/deploy: `npx` publish-install smoke on Node 18 and 20 |

## Unwired: `evals/run-eval.mjs`

These live-provider eval cases run only through `npm run eval`; their regex/heuristic scoring makes them behavioral probes, not deterministic golden masters.

| Case | Category | Rationale | Scenario-ledger entries covered |
|---|---|---|---|
| `math_derivation` | C2 | Evaluates useful, parseable math output. | Rendering: KaTeX parse errors (generated-source side) |
| `diagram_show` | C2 | Evaluates safe generated `show` content. | Rendering: injection via fences (generated-output side) |
| `eli5_lens` | C2 | Evaluates ELI5 lens behavior. | — |
| `example_lens` | C2 | Evaluates example lens behavior. | — |
| `deeper_lens` | C2 | Evaluates deeper lens behavior. | — |
| `code_explain` | C2 | Evaluates code-aware answers. | — |
| `empty_followup` | C2 | Evaluates a follow-up with empty selection, not an empty provider answer. | — |
| `synthesis` | C2 | Evaluates synthesis across nodes. | — |
| `long_doc_pack` | C2 | Evaluates answer length on a long context. | Data: very large holes (content-quality proxy only) |
| `title_sentinel` | C3 | Pins the current sentinel protocol Phase 6 contains and may later retire. | Generation: title never arrives (success side only) |
| `hostile_selection` | C2 | Evaluates safety under prompt-like selected text. | Rendering: injection via imported payloads (model-output side only) |
| `plain_factual` | C2 | Evaluates baseline factual response quality. | — |

## `stage18-generation-adapters-verify.mjs`

| Case | Category | Rationale | Scenario-ledger entries covered |
|---|---|---|---|
| OpenAI-compatible SSE fragmentation and framing | C3 | Deterministically pins the provider adapter's tolerant SSE framing across every byte boundary, multi-event reads, CRLF, and `[DONE]`. | Generation: durable streaming vocabulary (provider ingress) |
| Anthropic Messages SSE fragmentation and framing | C3 | Deterministically pins the fallback adapter's tolerant SSE framing across every byte boundary, multi-event reads, CRLF, and `[DONE]`. | Generation: durable streaming vocabulary (provider ingress) |
| title-sentinel fragmentation and terminal forms | C2 | Preserves branch title extraction and byte-identical visible markdown for every sentinel split offset, start/end placement, absent, malformed, and partial sentinels. | Generation: title never arrives; arbitrary provider chunking |
| provider error normalization | C2 | Preserves the browser-visible abort, provider, and network error vocabulary and retryability. | Generation: real stream abort; rate limits |
| branch GenerationEvent adapter containment | C2 | Requires exactly one title event, no sentinel leakage, and byte-exact text concatenation from fixture streams. | Generation: durable streaming vocabulary; title never arrives |
| authoring GenerationEvent adapters are text-only | C2 | Requires both provider brains' explainer/document surfaces to emit only text events while preserving provider bytes exactly. | Generation: durable streaming vocabulary |
| pure GenerationRun accumulator and DocEvent goldens | C2 | Pins full-text accumulation, monotonic run tags, late/fallback titles, empty completion, deterministic repeat completion, and rejection of non-generation/error input without host lifecycle ownership. | Generation: shared accumulation and transition construction |
| browser branch GenerationRun wiring | C2 | Requires browser branch GenerationEvents to produce the same progress/completion DocEvents as direct GenerationRun consumption. | Generation: shared accumulation and transition construction |
| MCP GenerationIngress normalization | C2 | Pins tail and repeated-full-answer normalization before GenerationEvents, tagged progress through GenerationRun, final title flow, and fresh run identity. | Generation: MCP durable streaming; shared accumulation and transition construction |
| browser branch retry run guard | C2 | Requires each retry to mint a new run id and rejects late progress from its superseded aborted run. | Generation: stale progress after newer progress; real stream abort |
| browser branch empty-stream completion | C2 | Preserves the intentional branch/root asymmetry: an empty branch stream completes with fallback title and empty markdown. | Generation: title never arrives (empty-stream side) |
| browser root GenerationRun wiring and empty rejection | C2 | Requires root explainer GenerationEvents to flow through GenerationRun while preserving rejection of empty and whitespace-only streams. | Generation: empty provider answer; shared accumulation and transition construction |
| document authoring through host lifecycle | C2 | Requires authoring to use host-owned run ids, abort ownership, reducer transitions, and save exactly on completion. | Generation: durable streaming vocabulary; real stream abort |
| retired text-delta seam absence | C2 | Prevents browser generation surfaces from bypassing GenerationRun through the temporary event-to-text helper. | Generation: shared accumulation and transition construction |
| browser lifecycle save flush | C2 | Requires hidden visibility and pagehide to invoke the existing host flush seam, closing the final debounce window without changing save policy. | Generation: browser durable partial markdown on tab close |

## Counts

Current inventory arithmetic: `46 + 154 + 11 + 3 + 0 = 214` total cases.

Counts treat each row above as one case; the shared Stage 9 contract counts once per backend because `npm test` executes it against both. Phase 5 Slice 2 added three C1 rows (`41 + 3 = 44`, `184 + 3 = 187`). Slice 3 added three C2 rows and reclassified the reducer mutation probe from C3 to C2: `129 + 3 + 1 = 133`, `10 - 1 = 9`, and `187 + 3 = 190` total. Slice 4 retires the stale-progress C4 as a C2 and adds four ordering goldens: `133 + 1 + 4 = 138`, `4 - 1 = 3`, and `190 + 4 = 194` total. Slice 5 adds one generation-vocabulary C2 case: `138 + 1 = 139` and `194 + 1 = 195` total. Slice 7 adds one content-vocabulary C2 case: `139 + 1 = 140` and `195 + 1 = 196` total. Slice 8 adds one hydration-wire C1 golden: `44 + 1 = 45` and `196 + 1 = 197` total. Slice 9 adds one packaging C1 case and one installed-launch C2 case: `45 + 1 = 46`, `140 + 1 = 141`, and `197 + 2 = 199` total. Phase 6 Slice 1 adds four C2 adapter/parser/error cases and two C3 SSE framing cases: `141 + 4 = 145`, `9 + 2 = 11`, and `199 + 6 = 205` total. Phase 6 Slice 2 adds two C2 cases: `145 + 2 = 147` and `205 + 2 = 207` total. Phase 6 Slice 3 adds three C2 browser-branch wiring cases: `147 + 3 = 150` and `207 + 3 = 210` total. Phase 6 Slice 4 adds three C2 root/authoring/seam-retirement cases: `150 + 3 = 153` and `210 + 3 = 213` total.

## Known-defect fossils

- `stage10-web-verify.mjs:179-224` pins rail padding (`12px`, `7px`, `8px`), bottom gap (`14px`), and width (`<=226px`): per-screen magic design values Phase 2 intends to centralize.
- `stage10-web-verify.mjs:421-442` retains settings surface equality and the optical gear offset; `stage10-web-verify.mjs:486-521` retains share surface equality and exact shell/item padding. Anchoring itself is now a C2 engine contract rather than a bespoke-geometry fossil.
- No assertion requires settings `innerHTML` rebuilding or focus-hunting. `stage2-verify.mjs:253-271` does rebuild a synthetic content container via `innerHTML`, but its asserted contract is visual mount identity/cache behavior, not that settings/chrome must rebuild. No current case asserts focus restoration after settings close, so the bespoke focus-hunting debt is unprotected rather than fossilized.
- `stage13-data-edges-verify.mjs` "hand-edited snapshot payload validation" is a skip-with-reason: snapshots currently have no inert import boundary, validator, or size cap (built in Phase 7).

## Baseline defects on record (found by instruments, not fixed)

- `FsStore.getAsset()` returns a `Buffer`, but `buildRabbitholeExport()` assumes Blob and calls `blob.arrayBuffer()` (`src/web/portable.js:139`) — exporting an asset-bearing hole directly from the filesystem store throws. Unreachable in today's product (web export runs against the IDB store, which returns Blobs), but it is a store-port contract violation; the typed store port (Phase 5) and artifact unification (Phase 7) must resolve it. stage13's round-trip test documents this with a test-local Blob-converting subclass.
- `base64ToBlob()` (`src/web/portable.js`) creates an untyped Blob, so a directly imported asset snapshots to an `application/octet-stream` data URL that the frozen image sanitizer rejects. Typed asset handling lands with the store port (Phase 5) / artifact unification (Phase 7). Pinned as C4 in stage15.

## Smoke-detector proof (Phase 1 exit criterion)

Run at commit 0853e1b (2026-07-10): five deliberate regressions, one per instrument class, each planted in `src/` and reverted after the verdict.

- Reducer semantics (node_progress append instead of replace) → **caught** by stage14 goldens.
- Export field drop (`font_scale` removed from the persisted projection) → **initially missed**: the round-trip test compared exports only against other exports, so the drop cancelled out. Fixed by anchoring `export(import(source))` to the source file; the re-planted regression now fails on the first fixture.
- Sanitizer loosening (event handlers allowed through show fences) → **caught** by stage15.
- Theme restoration ignored on load → **caught** by stage15's migration fixtures.
- 100 KiB bundle bloat → **caught** by stage16's `bundle_client_bytes` ceiling.

## Gap analysis

### Scenario-ledger entries with no covering test

“No covering test” means no case directly drives the stated scenario end to end; happy-path, structural, or analogous checks noted in tables do not count. Ordered by the phase that first needs the gap.

**Phase 1 — instruments/data/security baseline** (most entries closed by stages 13–16; remaining:)

- Data: genuinely very large holes with a budget (the wide-hole fixture and snapshot gauges only cover reference-sized content); extension-bag survival through an old build (refusal is covered; survival semantics await Phase 5 typing); hand-edited snapshot payload runtime rejection (C4 skip until the Phase 7 import boundary); export-vs-debounce timing for the MCP/filesystem projection (stage16's save-window gauge covers the web path only).
- Rendering: reduced motion; semantic dark parity.
- Migration/deploy: a real mid-session deploy (new code opening old IndexedDB, with migration rerun/idempotence — stage15 covers localStorage preferences, not the IDB schema during a live session); CLI version skew with an older CLI against additive wire changes; a v0.1-era hole retained through Phase 9.

**Phase 3 — settings vertical slice**

- Chrome: focus restoration on every overlay close; Escape/outside-click ordering with stacked overlays; anchored surfaces at every viewport edge; keyboard-only completion of every manifest flow; settings opened/changed during an active stream; Combobox behavior for slow, failed, and empty catalogs.

**Phase 6 — generation normalization**

- Generation: real stream abort; error mid-stream with browser-partial persistence and MCP-partial dropping/re-ask; stale progress after newer `{id,seq}` progress; empty provider answer; missing title fallback; N concurrent streams; delete while streaming; provider/model switch mid-stream; 401/403 during a stream with prompt-and-retry closure; rate limits; tab close mid-stream bounded by the save budget.

**Phase 7 — artifacts**

- Data: actual import-ID collision producing a fresh ID; frozen missing-asset `data:,` fallback. These belong with Phase 1 fixtures but become release gates no later than artifact unification.

### Part III instruments

| Instrument | Assessment | Evidence / missing work | First needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fixture corpus | **Exists** | `test/fixtures/corpus/` holds 20 curated files (math, show, assets, deep lineage, both durable-ask semantics, Unicode/RTL, `schema_version:null`, v0.2 legacy, wide holes) plus the in-test generated 20 MB boundary; stage13 drives all of them. | Phase 1 |
| Golden-master harness | **Partially exists** | stage14's reducer goldens (`test/fixtures/reducer-goldens/cases.json`) are true reviewable golden masters for state/effects. Renderer-side golden masters remain partial: Stage 8 asserts substrings, Stage 10 asserts geometry; no per-node semantic DOM projections or reasoned bless workflow yet. | Phase 1 |
| Round-trip property tests | **Exists** | stage13-roundtrip proves all 20 corpus fixtures are normalized fixed points, export-idempotent, and collision-safe through the filesystem projection; stage12 keeps the browser example. | Phase 1 |
| Live/frozen parity harness | **Partially exists** | stage15 asserts sanitizer, KaTeX/MathML, and asset parity on both paths under network denial; stages 1/4/6/8 inspect both outputs. A per-content-type semantic equivalence harness is still missing. | Phase 1 |
| Behavioral probes | **Partially exists** | Playwright covers composer, happy-path stream, settings basics, branching, ingestion, portability, and now credential/preference migrations (stage15) and streaming/save timing (stage16). Stream abort/retry, delete/undo during streams, mid-stream switching, focus, keyboard-only, and per-host durable-ask probes land with Phases 3/6. | Phase 1, expanded in Phases 3/6 |
| Budget gauges with tolerances | **Exists** | stage16 + `test/budgets.json` + `test/calibrate-budgets.mjs`: machine-relative ceilings with recorded tolerances for bundle bytes, snapshot bytes/build time, cold open, streaming rAF batch count/duration, and the save window. Layout-cost gauge still open. | Phase 1 |
