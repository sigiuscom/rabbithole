# Scenario-to-test manifest

This manifest classifies each logical test case, not each assertion. Categories are: **C1 compatibility contract** (external formats, wire protocols, migrations), **C2 behavioral product contract** (user-visible behavior changed only intentionally), **C3 implementation snapshot** (migration-disposable implementation detail), **C4 known defect** (a tripwire for behavior intended to be replaced), and **C5 design target** (new intended behavior written ahead of implementation). C4 cases are deliberately marked so they never become golden truth. Update this file whenever a test case is added, removed, split, renamed, or materially changed.

Scenario references use the Part VI group and shortened ledger wording. `—` means the case protects behavior outside the current ledger. Cases in the unwired eval are inventoried even though `npm test` does not run them.

|---|---|---|---|
| plain markdown images and show placeholders | C2 | Defines which images receive document image UX. | — |
| served/export image UX source and CSS sentinels | C3 | Searches function names, formulas, zoom constants, and selectors rather than behavior. | Rendering: dark parity (CSS-presence subset only) |

## `stage7-rearm-verify.mjs`

| Case | Category | Rationale | Scenario-ledger entries covered |
|---|---|---|---|
| keep-listening shape, grace, live reattach, waiter cleanup | C1 | Protects frozen MCP lifecycle responses and reattachment. | Migration/deploy: CLI version skew; Generation: abort mid-stream (MCP waiter cancellation only) |
| saved pending ask requeues once after resume | C1 | Protects MCP durable-ask/rehydration semantics. | Generation: error mid-stream → durable ask per host semantics (MCP re-ask behavior, without inducing an error) |

`support/store-contract.mjs` is an unwired helper, not an independently executed suite; its six exported cases are the six rows instantiated for each Stage 9 backend above.

## `stage10-web-verify.mjs`

| Case | Category | Rationale | Scenario-ledger entries covered |
|---|---|---|---|
| calm landing, three-path composer, path copy, dismiss-without-create | C2 | Protects first-run navigation and empty state. | — |
| blank-state centering and composer initial focus | C2 | Protects visible placement and initial keyboard focus. | Chrome: keyboard-only completion (small opening/closing subset) |
| warm re-entry, hash precedence, rail delete fallback | C2 | Protects saved-hole navigation and recovery. | — |
| first ask key validation and streamed root creation | C2 | Protects BYOK first-run streaming behavior. | Generation: 401/403 (pre-stream validation only); title never arrives (non-sentinel root title path only) |
| rail content/geometry exact values | C4 | Pins the Phase 2 semantic rail width, panel padding, and symmetric row-padding geometry. | — |
| keyboard-opened rail holds focus without a container ring; Escape closes only the rail | C2 | Focus policy: the panel takes focus so keys flow into rows, container emphasis must not impersonate the keyboard ring (was a UA `outline: auto` around the whole panel), and Escape must not fall through to the canvas client's open-the-reader shortcut (it did — the rail handler leaked propagation). | Chrome: keyboard-only completion (rail subset) |
| credentials stay isolated from holes/snapshots | C1 | Protects the no-export credential contract. | Data: preference/credential storage (isolation only, not migrations) |
| web snapshot export ships an empty style block | C4 | Records that web-exported frozen HTML is unstyled (`snapshot.js` serializes the page's inline `<style>`, which the web build does not emit; the styled export path lives in the canvas host). Phase 7's snapshot boundary fixes this and retires the tripwire. | Data: snapshot export styling |
| settings native provider select width/arrow/theme | C4 | Explicitly fossilizes the native select Phase 3 replaces. | — |
| provider switch, local model field, OpenRouter picker | C4 | Pins bespoke controls and provider id `custom` that Phase 3 replaces/migrates. | Chrome: Combobox catalogs (successful catalog only); settings during active stream (no active stream) |
| settings Field names and described-by connections | C2 | Requires all six settings text/password inputs to expose labels and resolvable hint or status descriptions (`stage10-web-verify.mjs:285-293`, `stage10-web-verify.mjs:454-465`). | Chrome: keyboard-only completion (settings field accessibility) |
| API key Field live status remains functional | C2 | Preserves the polite live-region contract through validation and its successful asynchronous update (`stage10-web-verify.mjs:466`, `stage10-web-verify.mjs:498-501`). | Data: preference/credential storage (status only) |
| Field halo and focus-visible-only keyboard ring | C2 | Enforces pointer focus without a keyboard ring, composite field halo emphasis, and keyboard-visible focus (`stage10-web-verify.mjs:467-483`). | Chrome: keyboard-only completion (settings focus treatment) |
| session-only key opt-out | C2 | Protects credential persistence choice. | Data: preference/credential storage (current behavior only) |
| settings anchor uses token gap/edge, flips, and repositions after content growth | C2 | Enforces the shared measure-flip-clamp engine and token-derived trigger-relative geometry (`stage10-web-verify.mjs:364-420`). | Chrome: anchored surfaces at viewport edges; content changes after open |
| nested settings layers close top-first on Escape | C2 | Enforces model-picker-before-settings stack ordering and prevents Escape from leaking to lower canvas shortcuts (`stage10-web-verify.mjs:445-452`). | Chrome: nested transient surfaces; keyboard-only completion |
| settings Escape/outside-pointer restore trigger focus | C2 | Enforces visible focus continuity for both stack dismissal paths (`stage10-web-verify.mjs:450-458`). | Chrome: focus restoration after transient surfaces |
| live math/code/show document rendering | C2 | Protects core authoring rendering. | — |
| share popover token anchor geometry, surface/padding, and focus restore | C2 | Enforces shared-engine trigger-relative placement and stack focus restoration while retaining the shared surface metrics (`stage10-web-verify.mjs:486-526`). | Chrome: anchored surfaces at viewport edges; focus restoration after transient surfaces |
| selection branch streams and titles | C2 | Protects selection-to-branch generation. | Generation: title never arrives (sentinel success only) |
| reader whole-document follow-up | C2 | Protects document chat branching. | — |
| streamed branches persist across reload; external request allowlist | C2 | Protects save/re-entry and network scope. | Generation: tab close mid-stream (post-completion reload only) |

## `fetch-proxy-worker-verify.mjs` (run by Stage 11)

| Case | Category | Rationale | Scenario-ledger entries covered |
|---|---|---|---|
| reject non-GET requests | C2 | Defines relay access policy. | — |
| reject unallowlisted hosts | C2 | Defines relay host policy. | — |
| strip request/response credentials and preserve CORS/content | C2 | Protects proxy security behavior. | — |
| enforce streaming 25 MB response cap | C2 | Protects resource limits while streaming. | — |

## `stage11-web-ingest-verify.mjs`

| Case | Category | Rationale | Scenario-ledger entries covered |
|---|---|---|---|
| browser PDF ingest is local and stores rendered pages/text | C2 | Protects offline browser PDF ingestion. | — |
| arXiv direct-fetch failure falls back to configured proxy | C2 | Protects URL/arXiv recovery behavior. | — |
| dead proxy produces actionable recovery copy | C2 | Protects designed ingest failure recovery. | — |
| relay rejection produces arXiv-specific guidance | C2 | Protects designed unsupported-host recovery. | — |

## `stage12-portability-verify.mjs`

| Case | Category | Rationale | Scenario-ledger entries covered |
|---|---|---|---|
| shell/settings polish including native select width | C4 | Repeats the native-select and magic-width fossil targeted by Phase 3. | — |
| improve-structure invokes author stream once | C2 | Protects document authoring generation. | — |
| PDF-backed `.rabbithole` export shape and credential exclusion | C1 | Protects the portable format and secret isolation. | Data: preference/credential storage (isolation only) |
| rail export filename | C2 | Protects user-visible download behavior. | — |
| portable import recreates document and binary asset | C1 | Protects cross-context portable import/export. | Data: import ID collision (fresh import only; no collision) |
| publish artifact files, redirects, and public copy | C1 | Protects deployment/package website output and URLs. | Migration/deploy: URLs/deploy compatibility (outside the four named ledger cases) |

## `stage13-data-edges-verify.mjs`

| Case | Category | Rationale | Scenario-ledger entries covered |
|---|---|---|---|
| future format_version is clearly refused | C1 | Protects the public portable-file version boundary and its recoverable refusal. | Data: future `format_version` clear refusal |
| future schema_version is legibly refused | C1 | Ensures old builds refuse unknown persisted schemas instead of silently dropping fields. | Data: new-format document through an old build refuses; future schema version |
| schema_version null backfills, persists, and reloads | C1 | Protects forever-readable legacy files and idempotent migration through the filesystem store. | Data: `schema_version: null` legacy backfill; Migration/deploy: old storage/idempotent migrations |
| malformed JSON, base64, and wrong-type fields reject without crashing | C1 | Exercises portable and schema trust boundaries with representative malformed inputs. | Data: malformed JSON/base64; hand-edited payload types |
| unicode, emoji, and RTL titles survive validate-persist-reload | C1 | Protects lossless international text across validation and filesystem persistence. | Data: unicode/emoji/RTL titles |
| hand-edited snapshot payload validation | C4 | Records that current snapshots have no import validator or size cap; skipped until the Phase 7 snapshot boundary exists. | Data: hand-edited snapshot payloads |
| exact 20 MB asset is accepted and one byte over is rejected | C1 | Pins both sides of the documented per-asset byte boundary using generated data. | Data: 20MB asset boundary |

## `stage13-roundtrip-verify.mjs`

| Case | Category | Rationale | Scenario-ledger entries covered |
|---|---|---|---|
| all corpus fixtures are normalized fixed points and export-idempotent | C1 | Protects portable migration, assets, durable asks, and filesystem persistence across repeated import/export projections. Exports are anchored to the source file (not merely to each other), so a field silently dropped by the export path cannot cancel out; the two legacy fixtures are exempt from source-anchoring because import deliberately migrates them. | Data: portable compatibility; `schema_version: null`; unicode/emoji/RTL; very wide holes; durable asks per host semantics |
| import collision mints a fresh hole_id and preserves content | C1 | Protects collision-safe identity generation without content or asset loss. | Data: import ID collision |

## `stage14-reducer-conformance.mjs`

| Case | Category | Rationale | Scenario-ledger entries covered |
|---|---|---|---|
| branch_request happy path | C2 | Pending branch construction and URL inheritance are observable document behavior. | — |
| branch_request missing parent throws | C2 | Invalid branch requests must fail rather than create detached nodes. | — |
| branch_request missing node_id throws | C2 | Branch nodes require stable identity. | — |
| node_progress grows then idempotently replays | C2 | Full-markdown replacement and same-text replay define current streaming behavior. | Generation: durable streaming (reducer side) |
| stale node_progress currently wins | C4 | Records the acknowledged lack of `{id, seq}` ordering without blessing it as product behavior; retired by the Phase 5/6 order guard. | Generation: stale progress after newer progress |
| node_answered updates existing pending node | C2 | Completing an existing pending node is core generation behavior. | — |
| node_answered synthesizes unknown node | C2 | Final answers may materialize a node when no pending node exists. | — |
| delete_node subtree collection and effects | C2 | Deletion must remove descendants and return sufficient effect data for consumers. | — |
| delete_node explicit node_ids and effects | C2 | Explicit deletion lists are part of reducer behavior and effect reporting. | — |
| root delete throws | C2 | The starting document is protected from node deletion. | — |
| node_update and nodes_update field application | C2 | Supported presentation fields must normalize consistently while unknown nodes remain untouched. | — |
| view_state normalization | C2 | Persisted navigation state has a normalized shape and bounded camera scale. | — |
| unknown event type throws | C2 | Unsupported vocabulary must fail explicitly rather than silently diverge. | — |
| prior-state node mutation probe | C3 | Measurement point for the Phase 5 purity decision; shared-node mutation is explicitly not a product contract. | — |
| Node/Chromium reducer parity | C2 | The deterministic DOM-free reducer must produce identical projections in both supported execution contexts. | — |

## `stage15-security-migrations-verify.mjs`

| Case | Category | Rationale | Scenario-ledger entries covered |
|---|---|---|---|
| imported and show-fence injection on live/frozen paths | C2 | Protects the user-visible security boundary for imported markdown and hydratable show content, including script, iframe, handler, JavaScript-URL, and SVG vectors. | Rendering: script/iframe/handler injection via fences and imported payloads, both paths |
| KaTeX errors and trusted structural markup | C2 | Requires invalid math to degrade safely while valid KaTeX MathML, semantics, annotations, and fraction structure survive both render paths. | Rendering: KaTeX parse errors; trusted MathML sanitizer parity |
| frozen asset-bearing document with all requests blocked | C1 | Frozen snapshots are a self-contained external artifact and must render their document and embedded assets without attempting network access. | Rendering: frozen viewing fully offline, zero fetches |
| current provider-key map canonical cleanup (`stage15-security-migrations-verify.mjs:150-153`) | C1 | Preserves current settings and key-map data while removing the retired single-key slot. | Data: preference/credential storage through every migration |
| single-key-era credential adoption (`stage15-security-migrations-verify.mjs:156-159`) | C1 | Requires lossless adoption into the provider-key map and retirement of the legacy slot. | Data: preference/credential storage through every migration |
| pre-popover custom/local canonical migration (`stage15-security-migrations-verify.mjs:162-165`) | C1 | Preserves local settings and session-only choice while adopting the stray OpenRouter-era credential without assigning it to Local. | Data: preference/credential storage through every migration |
| removed Anthropic/OpenAI provider canonical rewrite (`stage15-security-migrations-verify.mjs:168-177`) | C1 | Requires aliases to rewrite to OpenRouter defaults while preserving unrelated preferences and credentials. | Data: preference/credential storage through every migration; provider-id renames |
| malformed settings and credential-map normalization (`stage15-security-migrations-verify.mjs:180-187`) | C1 | Invalid settings JSON loads canonical defaults and an array key map normalizes to empty without throwing. | Data: malformed JSON/hand-edited preference storage; Migration/deploy: idempotent migrations |
| preference migration/load idempotence | C1 | Repeated application loads must not drift settings, credential keys, theme, or last-hole state. | Migration/deploy: new code opening old storage, idempotent migrations |
| credential exclusion from frozen exports | C1 | Device credentials and settings must never enter exported artifacts. | Data: preference/credential storage through every migration; artifact credential non-leakage |
| portable-import asset MIME metadata loss | C4 | Pins the known defect where base64 import creates an untyped Blob, preventing direct frozen reuse without a typed ingest asset. | Rendering: frozen viewing fully offline; Data: portable asset migration |

## `stage16-budget-gauges.mjs`

Gauges are machine-relative: `test/budgets.json` records `{baseline, tolerance, ceiling, rationale, measured_at_commit}` per gauge; `node test/calibrate-budgets.mjs` re-baselines deliberately. Any worsening requires an explicit recorded trade-off (THESEUS Part III).

| Case | Category | Rationale | Scenario-ledger entries covered |
|---|---|---|---|
| live + frozen client bundle byte gauges | C3 | Bundle sizes are implementation-relative; the ratcheted ceiling catches accidental bloat without blessing current size as a contract. | Data: bundle-size budget |
| snapshot byte gauges (math + asset reference corpus) | C2 | Frozen HTML is a user-shared artifact; its size envelope for reference content is product behavior. | Data: snapshot bytes budget |
| snapshot build-time gauges | C2 | Export must stay interactive-fast for reference content; min-of-samples with 3x ceiling absorbs host noise. | Data: snapshot build-time budget |
| cold-open gauge | C2 | Time to the visible interactive landing composer is the first-load product experience. | Rendering: cold open budget |
| streaming DOM batch count + duration gauges | C2 | A fixed 40-update synthetic stream must stay rAF-coalesced; losing batching is a user-visible regression. | Generation: streaming update budget (rAF count/duration) |
| save-window gauge | C2 | Elapsed time from final streamed update to persisted markdown bounds the data-loss window on tab close. | Data: export-vs-debounce save window (web path) |

## Unwired: `evals/run-eval.mjs`

These live-provider eval cases run only through `npm run eval`; their regex/heuristic scoring makes them behavioral probes, not deterministic golden masters.

| Case | Category | Rationale | Scenario-ledger entries covered |
|---|---|---|---|
| `math_derivation` | C2 | Evaluates useful, parseable math output. | Rendering: KaTeX parse errors (generated-source side) |
| `diagram_show` | C2 | Evaluates safe generated `show` content. | Rendering: injection via fences (generated-output side) |
| `eli5_lens` | C2 | Evaluates ELI5 lens behavior. | — |
| `example_lens` | C2 | Evaluates example lens behavior. | — |
| `deeper_lens` | C2 | Evaluates deeper lens behavior. | — |
| `code_explain` | C2 | Evaluates code-aware answers. | — |
| `empty_followup` | C2 | Evaluates a follow-up with empty selection, not an empty provider answer. | — |
| `synthesis` | C2 | Evaluates synthesis across nodes. | — |
| `long_doc_pack` | C2 | Evaluates answer length on a long context. | Data: very large holes (content-quality proxy only) |
| `title_sentinel` | C3 | Pins the current sentinel protocol Phase 6 contains and may later retire. | Generation: title never arrives (success side only) |
| `hostile_selection` | C2 | Evaluates safety under prompt-like selected text. | Rendering: injection via imported payloads (model-output side only) |
| `plain_factual` | C2 | Evaluates baseline factual response quality. | — |

## Counts

Counts treat each row above as one case; the shared Stage 9 contract counts once per backend because `npm test` executes it against both.

| Category | Count |
|---|---:|
| C1 compatibility contract | 41 |
| C2 behavioral product contract | 86 |
| C3 implementation snapshot | 10 |
| C4 known defect | 8 |
| C5 design target | 0 |
| **Total** | **145** |

## Known-defect fossils

- `stage10-web-verify.mjs:235-260` requires a native `<select>`, measures label-dependent width and label-to-arrow spacing, and checks native option theming. This is the exact Phase 3 native-select fossil.
- `stage10-web-verify.mjs:261-285` requires the bespoke local text input and OpenRouter picker and persists provider id `custom`; Phase 3 replaces these controls and includes provider-id migration.
- `stage12-portability-verify.mjs:182-191` independently requires the native provider `<select>` and an exact OpenRouter-label width band.
- `stage10-web-verify.mjs:179-224` pins rail padding (`12px`, `7px`, `8px`), bottom gap (`14px`), and width (`<=226px`): per-screen magic design values Phase 2 intends to centralize.
- `stage10-web-verify.mjs:421-442` retains settings surface equality and the optical gear offset; `stage10-web-verify.mjs:486-521` retains share surface equality and exact shell/item padding. Anchoring itself is now a C2 engine contract rather than a bespoke-geometry fossil.
- No assertion requires settings `innerHTML` rebuilding or focus-hunting. `stage2-verify.mjs:253-271` does rebuild a synthetic content container via `innerHTML`, but its asserted contract is visual mount identity/cache behavior, not that settings/chrome must rebuild. No current case asserts focus restoration after settings close, so the bespoke focus-hunting debt is unprotected rather than fossilized.
- `stage14-reducer-conformance.mjs` "stale node_progress currently wins" pins last-write-wins progress ordering — the gap the `{id, seq}` order guard (Phases 5/6) closes.
- `stage13-data-edges-verify.mjs` "hand-edited snapshot payload validation" is a skip-with-reason: snapshots currently have no inert import boundary, validator, or size cap (built in Phase 7).

## Baseline defects on record (found by instruments, not fixed)

- `FsStore.getAsset()` returns a `Buffer`, but `buildRabbitholeExport()` assumes Blob and calls `blob.arrayBuffer()` (`src/web/portable.js:139`) — exporting an asset-bearing hole directly from the filesystem store throws. Unreachable in today's product (web export runs against the IDB store, which returns Blobs), but it is a store-port contract violation; the typed store port (Phase 5) and artifact unification (Phase 7) must resolve it. stage13's round-trip test documents this with a test-local Blob-converting subclass.
- `base64ToBlob()` (`src/web/portable.js`) creates an untyped Blob, so a directly imported asset snapshots to an `application/octet-stream` data URL that the frozen image sanitizer rejects. Typed asset handling lands with the store port (Phase 5) / artifact unification (Phase 7). Pinned as C4 in stage15.
- Web-exported frozen snapshots carry no styles at all: `buildSnapshotHtml()` (`src/ui/snapshot.js:145`) serializes the page's first inline `<style>`, which exists in the canvas host (`src/node/html/canvas.js:30-33` inlines `CANVAS_STYLES` + KaTeX) but not in the web build, whose CSS arrives via an external `<link>`. Discovered during Phase 2 slice B review when an attempted inline-style injection moved the snapshot byte gauge +51KB. Fix lands with the Phase 7 snapshot boundary (styled, self-contained web exports incl. KaTeX) plus a snapshot-budget recalibration. Pinned as C4 in stage10.

## Smoke-detector proof (Phase 1 exit criterion)

Run at commit 0853e1b (2026-07-10): five deliberate regressions, one per instrument class, each planted in `src/` and reverted after the verdict.

- Reducer semantics (node_progress append instead of replace) → **caught** by stage14 goldens.
- Export field drop (`font_scale` removed from the persisted projection) → **initially missed**: the round-trip test compared exports only against other exports, so the drop cancelled out. Fixed by anchoring `export(import(source))` to the source file; the re-planted regression now fails on the first fixture.
- Sanitizer loosening (event handlers allowed through show fences) → **caught** by stage15.
- Theme restoration ignored on load → **caught** by stage15's migration fixtures.
- 100 KiB bundle bloat → **caught** by stage16's `bundle_client_bytes` ceiling.

## Gap analysis

### Scenario-ledger entries with no covering test

“No covering test” means no case directly drives the stated scenario end to end; happy-path, structural, or analogous checks noted in tables do not count. Ordered by the phase that first needs the gap.

**Phase 1 — instruments/data/security baseline** (most entries closed by stages 13–16; remaining:)

- Data: genuinely very large holes with a budget (the wide-hole fixture and snapshot gauges only cover reference-sized content); extension-bag survival through an old build (refusal is covered; survival semantics await Phase 5 typing); hand-edited snapshot payload runtime rejection (C4 skip until the Phase 7 import boundary); export-vs-debounce timing for the MCP/filesystem projection (stage16's save-window gauge covers the web path only).
- Rendering: reduced motion; semantic dark parity.
- Migration/deploy: a real mid-session deploy (new code opening old IndexedDB, with migration rerun/idempotence — stage15 covers localStorage preferences, not the IDB schema during a live session); CLI version skew with an older CLI against additive wire changes; `npx` publish-install smoke on Node 18 and 20; a v0.1-era hole retained through Phase 9.

**Phase 3 — settings vertical slice**

- Chrome: focus restoration on every overlay close; Escape/outside-click ordering with stacked overlays; anchored surfaces at every viewport edge; keyboard-only completion of every manifest flow; settings opened/changed during an active stream; Combobox behavior for slow, failed, and empty catalogs.

**Phase 6 — generation normalization**

- Generation: real stream abort; error mid-stream with browser-partial persistence and MCP-partial dropping/re-ask; stale progress after newer `{id,seq}` progress; empty provider answer; missing title fallback; N concurrent streams; delete while streaming; provider/model switch mid-stream; 401/403 during a stream with prompt-and-retry closure; rate limits; tab close mid-stream bounded by the save budget.

**Phase 7 — artifacts**

- Data: actual import-ID collision producing a fresh ID; frozen missing-asset `data:,` fallback. These belong with Phase 1 fixtures but become release gates no later than artifact unification.

### Part III instruments

| Instrument | Assessment | Evidence / missing work | First needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fixture corpus | **Exists** | `test/fixtures/corpus/` holds 20 curated files (math, show, assets, deep lineage, both durable-ask semantics, Unicode/RTL, `schema_version:null`, v0.2 legacy, wide holes) plus the in-test generated 20 MB boundary; stage13 drives all of them. | Phase 1 |
| Golden-master harness | **Partially exists** | stage14's reducer goldens (`test/fixtures/reducer-goldens/cases.json`) are true reviewable golden masters for state/effects. Renderer-side golden masters remain partial: Stage 8 asserts substrings, Stage 10 asserts geometry; no per-node semantic DOM projections or reasoned bless workflow yet. | Phase 1 |
| Round-trip property tests | **Exists** | stage13-roundtrip proves all 20 corpus fixtures are normalized fixed points, export-idempotent, and collision-safe through the filesystem projection; stage12 keeps the browser example. | Phase 1 |
| Live/frozen parity harness | **Partially exists** | stage15 asserts sanitizer, KaTeX/MathML, and asset parity on both paths under network denial; stages 1/4/6/8 inspect both outputs. A per-content-type semantic equivalence harness is still missing. | Phase 1 |
| Behavioral probes | **Partially exists** | Playwright covers composer, happy-path stream, settings basics, branching, ingestion, portability, and now credential/preference migrations (stage15) and streaming/save timing (stage16). Stream abort/retry, delete/undo during streams, mid-stream switching, focus, keyboard-only, and per-host durable-ask probes land with Phases 3/6. | Phase 1, expanded in Phases 3/6 |
| Budget gauges with tolerances | **Exists** | stage16 + `test/budgets.json` + `test/calibrate-budgets.mjs`: machine-relative ceilings with recorded tolerances for bundle bytes, snapshot bytes/build time, cold open, streaming rAF batch count/duration, and the save window. Layout-cost gauge still open. | Phase 1 |
