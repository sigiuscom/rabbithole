# Scenario-to-test manifest

This manifest classifies each logical test case, not each assertion. Categories are: **C1 compatibility contract** (external formats, wire protocols, migrations), **C2 behavioral product contract** (user-visible behavior changed only intentionally), **C3 implementation snapshot** (migration-disposable implementation detail), **C4 known defect** (a tripwire for behavior intended to be replaced), and **C5 design target** (new intended behavior written ahead of implementation). C4 cases are deliberately marked so they never become golden truth. Update this file whenever a test case is added, removed, split, renamed, or materially changed.

Scenario references use the Part VI group and shortened ledger wording. `—` means the case protects behavior outside the current ledger. Cases in the unwired eval are inventoried even though `npm test` does not run them.

## `stage13-data-edges-verify.mjs`

| Case | Category | Rationale | Scenario-ledger entries covered |

| branch_request missing node_id throws | C2 | Branch nodes require stable identity. | — |
| node_progress grows then idempotently replays | C2 | Full-markdown replacement and same-text replay define current streaming behavior. | Generation: durable streaming (reducer side) |
| stale node_progress currently wins | C4 | Records the acknowledged lack of `{id, seq}` ordering without blessing it as product behavior; retired by the Phase 5/6 order guard. | Generation: stale progress after newer progress |

| unknown event type throws | C2 | Unsupported vocabulary must fail explicitly rather than silently diverge. | — |
| prior-state node mutation probe | C3 | Measurement point for the Phase 5 purity decision; shared-node mutation is explicitly not a product contract. | — |
| Node/Chromium reducer parity | C2 | The deterministic DOM-free reducer must produce identical projections in both supported execution contexts. | — |

## Unwired: `evals/run-eval.mjs`

These live-provider eval cases run only through `npm run eval`; their regex/heuristic scoring makes them behavioral probes, not deterministic golden masters.

| Case | Category | Rationale | Scenario-ledger entries covered |
|---|---|---|---|
| `math_derivation` | C2 | Evaluates useful, parseable math output. | Rendering: KaTeX parse errors (generated-source side) |
| `diagram_show` | C2 | Evaluates safe generated `show` content. | Rendering: injection via fences (generated-output side) |
| `eli5_lens` | C2 | Evaluates ELI5 lens behavior. | — |
| `example_lens` | C2 | Evaluates example lens behavior. | — |
| `deeper_lens` | C2 | Evaluates deeper lens behavior. | — |
| `code_explain` | C2 | Evaluates code-aware answers. | — |
| `empty_followup` | C2 | Evaluates a follow-up with empty selection, not an empty provider answer. | — |
| `synthesis` | C2 | Evaluates synthesis across nodes. | — |
| `long_doc_pack` | C2 | Evaluates answer length on a long context. | Data: very large holes (content-quality proxy only) |
| `title_sentinel` | C3 | Pins the current sentinel protocol Phase 6 contains and may later retire. | Generation: title never arrives (success side only) |
| `hostile_selection` | C2 | Evaluates safety under prompt-like selected text. | Rendering: injection via imported payloads (model-output side only) |
| `plain_factual` | C2 | Evaluates baseline factual response quality. | — |

## Counts

Counts treat each row above as one case; the shared Stage 9 contract counts once per backend because `npm test` executes it against both.

| Category | Count |
|---|---:|
| C1 compatibility contract | 33 |
| C2 behavioral product contract | 71 |
| C3 implementation snapshot | 9 |
| C4 known defect | 8 |
| C5 design target | 0 |
| **Total** | **121** |

## Known-defect fossils

- `stage10-web-verify.mjs:235-260` requires a native `<select>`, measures label-dependent width and label-to-arrow spacing, and checks native option theming. This is the exact Phase 3 native-select fossil.
- `stage10-web-verify.mjs:261-285` requires the bespoke local text input and OpenRouter picker and persists provider id `custom`; Phase 3 replaces these controls and includes provider-id migration.
- `stage12-portability-verify.mjs:182-191` independently requires the native provider `<select>` and an exact OpenRouter-label width band.
- `stage10-web-verify.mjs:179-224` pins rail padding (`12px`, `7px`, `8px`), bottom gap (`14px`), and width (`<=226px`): per-screen magic design values Phase 2 intends to centralize.
- `stage10-web-verify.mjs:336-379` pins settings alignment, edge fallback, toolbar gap, and optical SVG offsets; `stage10-web-verify.mjs:408-445` pins share surface equality and exact shell/item padding. These fossilize bespoke anchoring/surface geometry that Phases 2–4 replace.
- No assertion requires settings `innerHTML` rebuilding or focus-hunting. `stage2-verify.mjs:253-271` does rebuild a synthetic content container via `innerHTML`, but its asserted contract is visual mount identity/cache behavior, not that settings/chrome must rebuild. No current case asserts focus restoration after settings close, so the bespoke focus-hunting debt is unprotected rather than fossilized.
- `stage14-reducer-conformance.mjs` "stale node_progress currently wins" pins last-write-wins progress ordering — the gap the `{id, seq}` order guard (Phases 5/6) closes.
- `stage13-data-edges-verify.mjs` "hand-edited snapshot payload validation" is a skip-with-reason: snapshots currently have no inert import boundary, validator, or size cap (built in Phase 7).

## Baseline defects on record (found by instruments, not fixed)

- `FsStore.getAsset()` returns a `Buffer`, but `buildRabbitholeExport()` assumes Blob and calls `blob.arrayBuffer()` (`src/web/portable.js:139`) — exporting an asset-bearing hole directly from the filesystem store throws. Unreachable in today's product (web export runs against the IDB store, which returns Blobs), but it is a store-port contract violation; the typed store port (Phase 5) and artifact unification (Phase 7) must resolve it. stage13's round-trip test documents this with a test-local Blob-converting subclass.

## Gap analysis

### Scenario-ledger entries with no covering test

“No covering test” means no case directly drives the stated scenario end to end; happy-path, structural, or analogous checks noted in tables do not count. Ordered by the phase that first needs the gap.

**Phase 1 — instruments/data/security baseline**

- Data: future `format_version` clear refusal; `schema_version: null` legacy backfill; exact 20 MB asset boundary generated in-test; malformed portable JSON/base64; unicode/emoji/RTL titles; genuinely very large holes with a budget; hand-edited snapshot payload runtime rejection; new-format document through an old build with extension-bag survival/refusal; preference/credential storage through every migration; export-vs-debounce timing per projection.
- Rendering: fence/payload script, iframe, and handler injection exercised on both live and frozen paths; KaTeX parse failure with proof trusted MathML is not sanitizer-damaged; reduced motion; semantic dark parity; frozen viewer opened offline with zero fetches.
- Migration/deploy: a real mid-session deploy (new code opening old IndexedDB, with migration rerun/idempotence); CLI version skew with an older CLI against additive wire changes; `npx` publish-install smoke on Node 18 and 20; a v0.1-era hole retained through Phase 9. (The IDB v0.2 fixture is useful migration coverage, but does not exercise deployment during a session.)

**Phase 3 — settings vertical slice**

- Chrome: focus restoration on every overlay close; Escape/outside-click ordering with stacked overlays; anchored surfaces at every viewport edge; keyboard-only completion of every manifest flow; settings opened/changed during an active stream; Combobox behavior for slow, failed, and empty catalogs.

**Phase 6 — generation normalization**

- Generation: real stream abort; error mid-stream with browser-partial persistence and MCP-partial dropping/re-ask; stale progress after newer `{id,seq}` progress; empty provider answer; missing title fallback; N concurrent streams; delete while streaming; provider/model switch mid-stream; 401/403 during a stream with prompt-and-retry closure; rate limits; tab close mid-stream bounded by the save budget.

**Phase 7 — artifacts**

- Data: actual import-ID collision producing a fresh ID; frozen missing-asset `data:,` fallback. These belong with Phase 1 fixtures but become release gates no later than artifact unification.

### Part III instruments

| Instrument | Assessment | Evidence / missing work | First needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fixture corpus | **Partially exists** | Small inline fixtures cover math, show, assets, PDFs, and one v0.2 migration; there is no curated ~20-file corpus, explicit `schema_version:null`, Unicode/RTL, deep lineage, both durable-ask semantics, or generated exact-boundary fixture. | Phase 1 |
| Golden-master harness | **Partially exists** | Stage 8 calls renderer cases “golden,” but asserts substrings; Stage 10 asserts geometry. There are no per-node semantic DOM projections, targeted screenshots, volatile-field normalization, or reasoned bless workflow. | Phase 1 |
| Round-trip property tests | **Partially exists** | Stage 12 performs one browser portable export/import example and compares a hand projection. No property generation, fixed points for every projection, repeated round trips, or normalization rules for timestamps/collision IDs. | Phase 1 |
| Live/frozen parity harness | **Partially exists** | Stages 1/4/6/8 inspect both outputs and Stage 8 separately renders frozen content, but there is no per-content-type semantic equivalence harness. | Phase 1 |
| Behavioral probes | **Partially exists** | Playwright covers composer, happy-path stream, settings basics, branching, ingestion, and portability; nearly all required stream/abort/retry, delete/undo/assets, mid-stream switching, focus, keyboard-only, and per-host durable-ask probes are missing. | Phase 1, expanded in Phases 3/6 |
| Budget gauges with tolerances | **Missing** | Stage 1 prints CSS/page bytes and optional Stage 5 prints timing/size, while Stage 10 uses sleeps and hardcoded geometry; none records baseline ceilings with tolerances for rAF update count/duration, layout cost, snapshot bytes/build time, cold open, save window, or bundle sizes. | Phase 1 |
