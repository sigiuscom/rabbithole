/**
 * Content and learning-primitive vocabulary for Phases 6–8.
 *
 * Runtime authority today is split. {@link ../markdown-renderer.js}
 * (`createMarkdownRenderer`) owns closed-fence dispatch: renderers are stored
 * by lowercased language and registered as `registerFenceRenderer(language,
 * render)`. `show` is the only built-in registration; unknown fences fall
 * through to highlighted/plain code. Its separate, hardcoded `show` tokenizer
 * emits the pending placeholder for an unclosed fence. {@link ../markdown.js}
 * exposes the same two-argument registration for the shared Node renderer.
 * Consequently `MarkdownExtension` describes that language/render pair; it is
 * not a claim that an object-shaped plugin registry exists at runtime.
 *
 * Client upgrade authority is {@link ../../ui/visuals.js}. Both
 * {@link ../../ui/entry.js} and {@link ../../ui/frozen-entry.js} call
 * `mountVisuals`, which finds `.viz[data-viz][data-src]`, skips pending
 * placeholders, base64-decodes the source, dispatches through the separate
 * `registerVisualHandler(type, build)` registry, and replaces the placeholder
 * with cached DOM. There is no `HydratableBlock` registry or lifecycle contract
 * today.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — PROVISIONAL AND REVISABLE: Phase 8's content spike owns the final
 * hydratable-block, primitive, lifecycle, identity, state, and security formats.
 * A future content-model revision may change these declarations without
 * migration obligations. These names let current code share vocabulary; they
 * do not freeze a serialized format or promise compatibility for authored or
 * learner state.
